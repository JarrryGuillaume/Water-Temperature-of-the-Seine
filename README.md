# Water-Temperature-of-the-Seine


This is a current research project trying to model the temperature of the Seine River using LSTMs Neural Network and the Meteo-France SAFRAN dataset whch documents of the temperature of the air around the greater Paris region since 1970. 

This research project is under the supervision of Agnès Rivière (researcher at Mines Paris, Geoscience Center) and William Thomas who has put together the dataset utlized for many years by asking various water and research center user around the Paris region. Hs outstanding contribution is the most documented dataset on the water temperature of this region to date, and we thank him for providing the fuel for ou Neural Network.
